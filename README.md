# timezone-bot in the darkness

A simple timezone bot for Discord servers.

## Commands:

- `t!time <user, role, or location name>` to see the current time for a specific user or in a specific place.
- `t!timein <location name>` to see the current time in a specific place.
- `t!set <city or country name>` to set your own timezone. (UTC codes also work, e.g. 'UTC+3', 'UTC-8')
- `t!users` or `t!all` to see all users' set timezones. (use `t!here` to restrict to the current channel)
- `t!count` to see timezone counts. (`t!count here` works)
- `t!role <@role or role name>`to see the timezones for all users in a role.
- `t!at <time> <user or location>` to see all users' times from the viewpoint of a specific time and place. Day of the week is optional. (i.e. `t!at Mon 5PM Cairo`. Use `t!at here <time> <user or location>` to restrict to the current channel.)
- `t!me` to see your set timezone.
- `t!removeme` to delete your set timezone.
- `t!stamp <time> <user or location>` - Generate copyable Discord timestamps.
- `t!info` or `t!help` to show a message listing all commands.

#### Admin-only commands:

- `t!prefix <new prefix>` to set the prefix for bot commands. Defaults to "t!"
- `t!setuser <@user> <location name>` - Set the timezone for a user in the server.
- `t!removeuser <@user>` - Remove the timezone for a user in the server.
- `t!format` - Toggles between 12 and 24-hour format.
- `t!autorespond` - Toggles auto-responses on/off.
- `t!adminonly` - Toggles admin mode on/off. (Only server admins can invoke most commands)
- `t!deletecommand` - Toggles bot command deletion on/off.
- `t!deleteresponse <number of seconds (optional)>` - Sets bot response deletion time. Don't add a number to turn off.
- `t!suppresswarnings` - Toggles bot admin warnings on/off.

(Most commands can be run by using the first letter of the command, e.g. 't!s Chicago' to set. 't!time' becomes 't!t'.)
